      "Good Tour, Really Well Organised. The tour was very well organised. One minus is that you get completely bombarded with information. You also have to stand up for too long at the private entrance to the Tower of London, which leads to a lack of time later. Lunch was the same, too stress, the quality was great but you couldn't enjoy it.",
